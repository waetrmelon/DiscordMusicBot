## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Installation

1. Ensure you have Python v3.11 installed on your machine.
2. Clone the repository, the project does rely on the following libraries:
- discord.py -> ```pip3 install discord```
- youtube_search -> ```pip3 install youtube-search```
- pytube -> ```pip3 install pytube```

##  ```Warning``` : the interpreter is nowhere near ready to be used, many bugs currently exist, as it's very early into development.


### Using the Bot
